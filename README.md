**SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION:**
First We will dicuss about regression,Regression is actually a statistical approach in which we express the relationship between a dependent variable(x) and more independent variable(y).
There are 3 types of regression:
1.**Simple Linear Regression**:It is a type of regression in which single dependent variable(x) and single independent variable(y) will be there.We will use single independent variable to predict the dependent variable.
2.**Multiple Linear Regression**:It is a type of regression in which single dependent variable(x) and multiple independent variable(y) will be there.We will use multiple independent variable to predict the dependent variable.
3.**Non-Linear Regression**:It is a type of regression in which the dependent variable and independent variable follows a non linear pattern.
